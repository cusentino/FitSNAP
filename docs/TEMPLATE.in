# This file provides a one-line description of all the keywords that can be assigned in the 
# FitSNAP3 input file. Each keyword can only be used within the category to which it belongs. 
# The categories are as follows:
#  [BISPECTRUM]   SNAP potential options
#  [MODEL]        SNAP fitting options
#  [PATH]         locations of training data and meta-data
#  [OUTFILE]      output options
#  [REFERENCE]    SNAP reference potential
# 
# The syntax for keyword assignment is
# <keyword> = <value>
# In this file, we follow each keyword with a comment:
# <keyword> = <value> # (<DATATYPE>) <Description>
# The allowable datatypes are:
#   INT    integer constant
#   REAL   floating point constant
#   STR    test string
#   BOOL   boolean constant ("True" values: y, yes, t, true, on and 1, "False" values: n, no, f, false, off and 0.)

[BISPECTRUM]

rmin0 = 0.0        # (REAL) Parameter in distance to angle conversion
wj1 = 1.0          # (REAL) Element weight for first element
wj2 = 1.0          # (REAL)   wj keywords with integer suffixes 1 to numTypes
radelem1 = 0.5     # (REAL) Radius of element 1, i-i' cutoff is rcutfac*(R_i + R_i')

type1 = Ta         # (STR)  Chemical symbol for this element, has to match JSON training files
type2 = W          # (STR)    type keywords with integer suffixes 1 to numTypes
BOLTZT = 1000      # (REAL) Advanced Feature. Use a Boltzmann weighting to training at this temperature

[MODEL]
bzeroflag = 0	     # (BOOL) Subtract vacuum bispectrum, so isolated atoms have energy=0
quadraticflag = 0    # (BOOL) Include quadratic terms in SNAP energy model
solver = SVD	     # (STR)  Linear solver algorithm used (SVD, LASSO, RIDGE, ELASTIC allowed)
normweight = -12     # (REAL) If solver!=SVD, this is the log of the penalty term coefficient
normratio = 0.5	     # (REAL) If solver==ELASTIC this is ratio of the linear and quadratic penalty terms
compute_dbvb = 1     # (BOOL) If true, fit is done on energy, forces and virials. False, only energy.
compute_testerrs = 0 # (BOOL) If less than the full training set is used in fitting, a true value will calculate the errors on the remaining, unused training. In the output, group names are appended with CV_Train and CV_Test to designate the fitted and testing training errors.
smartweights = 0     # (BOOL) If true, a new grouplist will be made where the weights for energies, forces, and virials are (1/N_rows) where N_rows is the number of rows per group in the A matrix.  If no grouplist is specified, smartweights will automatically be used.

[PATH]
jsonPath = JSON          # (STR) Path to the training data JSON directory
groupFile = grouplist.in # (STR) Path to the training data metadata file

[OUTFILE]
metrics = newsnap_metrics.csv    # (STR) Overall errors and broken down by group, weighting, and variable type.
configs = Ta_configs.pkl.gz      # (STR) Currently disabled due to large I/O cost
potential = Ta_pot               # (STR) Base name of SNAP potential files, i.e. Ta_pot.snapparam and Ta_pot.snapcoeff
